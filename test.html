<p>Day one at emobilis was a success.
  We were taught on some introduction to some coding techniques in which i learnt new way and gathered new ideas.
  Though i felt that time was running out and saw that the lesson was too short and time had
    slept my way i had to make sure that the next lesson i was more attentive than the first time.
  It was interesting for our lecturer was fun and made sure that allof us participated fully</p>
